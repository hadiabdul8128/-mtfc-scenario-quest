# Step-by-Step: Connect Your GPT to Cursor

## STEP 1: Copy Your API Key
Copy your **own** OpenAI API key from the OpenAI dashboard and keep it private. Paste it in the steps below.

## STEP 2: Open Cursor Settings
- Press: `Cmd + ,` (Command + Comma)
- OR click: `Cursor` → `Settings` (in the menu bar)

## STEP 3: Find AI/Model Settings
Look for one of these options:
- `Features` → `AI`
- `Models`
- `AI Settings`
- `Custom Models`
- `Model Provider`

## STEP 4: Paste Your API Key
- Find the field that says "API Key", "OpenAI API Key", or "Custom API Key"
- Click in that field
- Press: `Cmd + V` to paste
- Click "Save" or "Apply"

## STEP 5: Restart Cursor (if needed)
- Close Cursor completely
- Reopen it
- Your GPT should now be connected!

## Alternative: If you can't find the settings

If you don't see the AI/Model settings in Cursor:

1. **Check Cursor version** - Make sure you have the latest version
2. **Look for "Preferences"** instead of "Settings"
3. **Search in settings** - Use `Cmd + F` to search for "API" or "key"
