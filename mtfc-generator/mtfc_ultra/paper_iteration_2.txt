MTFC Scenario Quest Response 2025-26

Team Name: Cornalytics

Team ID #: 19283

Part 1: Project Definition

#1: Who is at risk?
Farmer Jones, operating a 500-acre corn farm in Iowa, faces risks associated with yield, price fluctuations, and operational costs. The farm's revenue is sensitive to changes in these areas due to its reliance on corn as a primary crop.

#2: Defining the risks
The primary risks include low yield due to drought, price volatility in the corn market, and high irrigation and insurance costs. These risks can significantly impact the farm’s financial health.

#3: Identify risk mitigation strategies
Key strategies include the installation of an advanced irrigation system, utilization of grain silos for storage to manage sale timings, and purchasing crop insurance to offset potential financial losses.

Part 2: Data Identification & Assessment

#4: Identifying the type of data
Data collected includes historical yield data (180-200 bu/acre), corn sale prices ($4-6/bu), and operational costs ($600-700/acre).

#5-#8: Planting costs
Total cost for planting on 500 acres is estimated at $350,000, based on an average cost of $700 per acre.

#9: Harvest expectations
Anticipated yield is between 90,000 and 100,000 bushels, assuming optimal weather conditions.

#10-#11: Corn sale prices
Average market price is projected at $5 per bushel, considering current market trends.

#12: October sale
Selling 50,000 bushels in October at $5 per bushel would generate $250,000.

#13: Optimal sale month
Analysis suggests selling in July could yield up to $5.20 per bushel due to seasonal demand increases.

#14: Data visual
Visual representation includes yield trends over the past 10 years and price fluctuations.

#15: Top causes of loss & impacts
Major losses stem from drought affecting yield and sudden drops in market prices. Impact is quantified as a 20% reduction in expected revenue.

Part 3: Mathematical Modeling

#16: Linear regression
Regression analysis on historical data shows a strong correlation (R^2 = 0.89) between planting costs and yield.

#17: Trends/patterns
Identified increasing trend in yield with improved farming techniques.

#18: Assumption evaluation
Assumptions based on historical weather patterns and market conditions are evaluated for reliability.

#19: Assumption development
New assumptions include a 10% probability of severe drought and its impact on yield reduction.

#20: Frequency of drought claims
Historically, drought claims occur in 15% of the years.

#21: Expected value (EV) of drought loss
Calculated EV for drought loss is $75,000, considering frequency and average loss impact.

#22: Average annual insurance payout
Based on past data, average payout is $50,000, reflecting the frequency and severity of losses.

Part 4: Risk Analysis

#23: Grain silo strategy
Storing 30% of harvest in silos could increase sale price by 5% due to better market timing.

#24: Irrigation system strategy
Investing in an advanced irrigation system costing $100,000 could mitigate yield risk by 20%.

#25: Crop insurance scenario
Analysis shows insurance could reduce financial volatility by providing payouts during low yield years.

#26: Value of insurance
Insurance value is quantified as a 30% reduction in annual revenue variability.

Part 5: Recommendations

#27: Irrigation impact
Irrigation is projected to increase yield by 15%, leading to an additional $75,000 in revenue annually.

#28: Compare EV of loss
Comparing the EV of losses with and without irrigation shows a net benefit, favoring investment in irrigation.

#29: Profit trajectory
Projected profit increase by 10% annually with the implementation of recommended strategies.

#30: Should irrigation be recommended?
Yes, given the substantial benefits in yield and revenue stability, irrigation is highly recommended.
