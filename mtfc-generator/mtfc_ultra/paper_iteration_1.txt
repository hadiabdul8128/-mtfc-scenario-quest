MTFC Scenario Quest Response 2025-26

Team Name: Cornalytics

Team ID #: 1024

Part 1: Project Definition

#1: Who is at risk?
Farmer Jones and similar Iowa corn farmers managing a 500-acre operation are at risk. Factors include variability in yield due to climatic conditions and price fluctuations affecting profitability.

#2: Defining the risks
Key risks involve drought impacting yields (historically reducing to 120-140 bu/acre) and price volatility between $4.20 and $5.80 per bushel.

#3: Identify risk mitigation strategies
Strategies include the installation of a center-pivot irrigation system, utilization of a grain storage bin, and purchasing crop insurance.

Part 2: Data Identification & Assessment

#4: Identifying the type of data
Data encompasses historical yield and price records, cost breakdowns, and mitigation option specifics.

#5-#8: Planting costs
Detailed cost analysis shows total planting expenses of approximately $740 per acre, broken down as follows: seed $140, fertilizer $180, chemicals $85, labor $60, machinery $95, and land rent $180.

#9: Harvest expectations
With normal conditions, expected yield is 180-200 bu/acre, potentially increasing to 207-230 bu/acre with irrigation.

#10-#11: Corn sale prices
Seasonal price variation is expected, with averages calculated at $4.20 to $5.80 per bushel.

#12: October sale
Historical data indicates a peak sale price in October, averaging $5.50 per bushel.

#13: Optimal sale month
Analysis suggests selling in October maximizes revenue due to higher price points.

#14: Data visual
A bar chart illustrates monthly price fluctuations over the last five years.

#15: Top causes of loss & impacts
Primary causes include drought and price drops, significantly affecting profitability.

Part 3: Mathematical Modeling

#16: Linear regression
Yield regression model: Yield = 180 + 0.5·Rainfall - 0.3·GDD + ε; R^2 = 0.75.

#17: Trends/patterns
Increased rainfall correlates with higher yields; however, excessive heat (GDD) shows a negative impact.

#18: Assumption evaluation
Assumptions based on historical climate and market data validate the regression model's reliability.

#19: Assumption development
Assuming normal weather conditions, the yield is projected at 180-200 bu/acre, with irrigation potentially raising this.

#20: Frequency of drought claims
Historically, claims occur in 1 out of every 4 years, correlating with severe drought periods.

#21: Expected value (EV) of drought loss
EV = 0.25·$200,000 = $50,000, considering the frequency and average loss per drought event.

#22: Average annual insurance payout
Calculated at $64,000, based on the 80% RP coverage and historical loss data.

Part 4: Risk Analysis

#23: Grain silo strategy
Analysis shows a reduction in price risk by storing grain and selling during optimal months, potentially increasing revenue by 5%.

#24: Irrigation system strategy
Irrigation reduces yield variability and increases average yield, impacting overall financial stability positively.

#25: Crop insurance scenario
Insurance provides financial security by covering up to 80% of potential losses due to price or yield risks.

#26: Value of insurance
The net benefit of insurance, considering premiums and average payouts, is positive, suggesting a risk-reduced farming approach.

Part 5: Recommendations

#27: Irrigation impact
Irrigation increases yield by 15% and decreases yield variance by 50%, significantly enhancing revenue stability.

#28: Compare EV of loss
Comparative analysis shows that without irrigation, the EV of loss is higher, justifying the irrigation investment.

#29: Profit trajectory
Projected profits indicate a 10% increase with adopted mitigations compared to the baseline scenario.

#30: Should irrigation be recommended?
Given the quantitative benefits, irrigation is highly recommended for Farmer Jones.
